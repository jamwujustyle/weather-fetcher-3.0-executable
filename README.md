executable. will average temperature data taken from multiple APIs subsequently storing the average to a smart contract
focused on front rather than back with implementation of smart contracts. used pipreqs to collect requirements on your local machine run: "pip install -r requirements'txt". 
when clicked "store to contract keep an eye on the terminal the txh is supposed to show up. take this txh to "https://sepolia.etherscan.io/" and paste in a search bar. there you can find detailed info about the transaction. in sepolia you can also see all the stored temperature information ever stored to the blockchain and it is impossible to change hack or malfunction. there are thousands of blocks running on different nodes accross the world and as long as one of the nodes is running all the information stored in those chains is secure. using blockchain and smartcontracts is an overkill for a project like mine but the concept is rather interesting!
