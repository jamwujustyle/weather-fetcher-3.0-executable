executable. averages temperature data taken from multiple APIs subsequently storing the average to a smart contract
focused on front rather than back with implementation of smart contracts. used pipreqs to collect requirements on your local machine run: "pip install -r requirements'txt". 
when clicked "store to contract keep an eye on the terminal the txh is supposed to show up. take this txh to "https://sepolia.etherscan.io/" and paste in the search engine. there you can find detailed info about the transaction. in sepolia you can also see all the stored temperature information ever stored to the blockchain and it is impossible to change hack or corrupt in any way. there are thousands of blocks running on different nodes accross the world and as long as one of the nodes is running all the information stored on the chain is safe. using blockchain and smartcontracts is an overkill for a project as such but the concept is quite interesting!
